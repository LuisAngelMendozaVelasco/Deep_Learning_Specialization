# ML Strategy (1)

Streamline and optimize your ML production workflow by implementing strategic guidelines for goal-setting and applying human-level performance to help define key priorities.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain why Machine Learning strategy is important
- Apply satisficing and optimizing metrics to set up your goal for ML projects
- Choose a correct train/dev/test split of your dataset
- Define human-level performance
- Use human-level performance to define key priorities in ML projects
- Take the correct ML Strategic decision based on observations of performances and dataset
