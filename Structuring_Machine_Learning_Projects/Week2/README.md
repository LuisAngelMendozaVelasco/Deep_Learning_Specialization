# ML Strategy (2)

Develop time-saving error analysis procedures to evaluate the most worthwhile options to pursue and gain intuition for how to split your data and when to use multi-task, transfer, and end-to-end deep learning.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe multi-task learning and transfer learning
- Recognize bias, variance and data-mismatch by looking at the performances of your algorithm on train/dev/test sets
