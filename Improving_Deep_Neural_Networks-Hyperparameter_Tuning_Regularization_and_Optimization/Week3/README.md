# Hyperparameter Tuning, Batch Normalization and Programming Frameworks

Explore TensorFlow, a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks quickly and easily, then train a neural network on a TensorFlow dataset.

## Learning Objectives

- Master the process of hyperparameter tuning
- Describe softmax classification for multiple classes
- Apply batch normalization to make your neural network more robust
- Build a neural network in TensorFlow and train it on a TensorFlow dataset
- Describe the purpose and operation of GradientTape
- Use tf.Variable to modify the state of a variable
- Apply TensorFlow decorators to speed up code
- Explain the difference between a variable and a constant
