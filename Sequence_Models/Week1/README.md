# Recurrent Neural Networks

Discover recurrent neural networks, a type of model that performs extremely well on temporal data, and several of its variants, including LSTMs, GRUs and Bidirectional RNNs.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the main components of an LSTM
- Implement backpropagation through time for a basic RNN and an LSTM
- Give examples of several types of RNN
- Build a character-level text generation model using an RNN
- Store text data for processing using an RNN
- Sample novel sequences in an RNN
- Explain the vanishing/exploding gradient problem in RNNs
- Apply gradient clipping as a solution for exploding gradients
- Describe the architecture of a GRU
- Use a bidirectional RNN to take information from two points of a sequence
- Stack multiple RNNs on top of each other to create a deep RNN
- Use the flexible Functional API to create complex models
- Generate your own jazz music with deep learning
- Apply an LSTM to a music generation task
