# Sequence Models & Attention Mechanism

Augment your sequence models using an attention mechanism, an algorithm that helps your model decide where to focus its attention given a sequence of inputs. Then, explore speech recognition and how to deal with audio data.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe a basic sequence-to-sequence model
- Compare and contrast several different algorithms for language translation
- Optimize beam search and analyze it for errors
- Use beam search to identify likely translations
- Apply BLEU score to machine-translated text
- Implement an attention model
- Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions
- Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
- Structure a speech recognition project
