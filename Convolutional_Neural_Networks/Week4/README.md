# Special Applications: Face recognition & Neural Style Transfer

Explore how CNNs can be applied to multiple fields, including art generation and face recognition, then implement your own algorithm to generate art and recognize faces!

## Learning Objectives

- Differentiate between face recognition and face verification
- Implement one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem
- Apply the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition
- Explain how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem
- Map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained model
- Perform face verification and face recognition with these encodings
- Implement the Neural Style Transfer algorithm
- Generate novel artistic images using Neural Style Transfer
- Define the style cost function for Neural Style Transfer
- Define the content cost function for Neural Style Transfer
