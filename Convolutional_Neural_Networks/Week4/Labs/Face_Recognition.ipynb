In this assignment, you're going to build a face recognition system. Many of the ideas presented here are from [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). In the lecture, you also encountered [DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf).\n","\n","Face recognition problems commonly fall into one of two categories: \n","\n","**Face Verification** \"Is this the claimed person?\" For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.\n","\n","**Face Recognition** \"Who is this person?\" For example, the video lecture showed a [face recognition video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.\n","\n","FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.\n","\n","By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to: \n","\n","* Differentiate between face recognition and face verification\n","* Implement one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem\n","* Apply the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition\n","* Explain how to pose face recognition as a binary classification problem\n","* Map face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained model\n","* Perform face verification and face recognition with these encodings\n","\n","**Channels-last notation**\n","\n","For this assignment, you'll be using a pre-trained model which represents ConvNet activations using a \"channels last\" convention, as used during the lecture and in previous programming assignments.\n","\n","In other words, a batch of images will be of shape $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$.
