The backward pass for convolutional networks is complicated. If you wish, you can work through this optional portion of the notebook to get a sense of what backprop in a convolutional network looks like. \n","\n","When in an earlier course you implemented a simple (fully connected) neural network, you used backpropagation to compute the derivatives with respect to the cost to update the parameters. Similarly, in convolutional neural networks you can calculate the derivatives with respect to the cost in order to update the parameters. The backprop equations are not trivial and were not derived in lecture, but  are briefly presented below.\n","\n","<a name='5-1'></a>\n","### 5.1 - Convolutional Layer Backward Pass \n","\n","Let's start by implementing the backward pass for a CONV layer. \n","\n","<a name='5-1-1'></a>\n","#### 5.1.1 - Computing dA:\n","This is the formula for computing $dA$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$ and a given training example:\n","\n","$$dA \\mathrel{+}= \\sum _{h=0} ^{n_H} \\sum_{w=0} ^{n_W} W_c \\times dZ_{hw} \\tag{1}$$\n","\n","Where $W_c$ is a filter and $dZ_{hw}$ is a scalar corresponding to the gradient of the cost with respect to the output of the conv layer Z at the hth row and wth column (corresponding to the dot product taken at the ith stride left and jth stride down). Note that at each time, you multiply the same filter $W_c$ by a different dZ when updating dA. We do so mainly because when computing the forward propagation, each filter is dotted and summed by a different a_slice. Therefore when computing the backprop for dA, you are just adding the gradients of all the a_slices. \n","\n","In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:\n","```python\n","da_prev_pad[vert_start:vert_end, horiz_start:horiz_end, :] += W[:,:,:,c] * dZ[i, h, w, c]\n","```\n","\n","<a name='5-1-2'></a>\n","#### 5.1.2 - Computing dW:\n","This is the formula for computing $dW_c$ ($dW_c$ is the derivative of one filter) with respect to the loss:\n","\n","$$dW_c  \\mathrel{+}= \\sum _{h=0} ^{n_H} \\sum_{w=0} ^ {n_W} a_{slice} \\times dZ_{hw}  \\tag{2}$$\n","\n","Where $a_{slice}$ corresponds to the slice which was used to generate the activation $Z_{ij}$.
