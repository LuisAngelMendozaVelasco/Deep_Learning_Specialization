# Neural Networks Basics

Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up your models.

## Learning Objectives

- Build a logistic regression model structured as a shallow neural network
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including parameter initialization, cost function and gradient calculation, and optimization implemetation (gradient descent)
- Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models
- Compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset
- Use Numpy functions and Numpy matrix/vector operations
- Work with iPython Notebooks
- Implement vectorization across multiple training examples
- Explain the concept of broadcasting
