# Shallow Neural Networks

Build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe hidden units and hidden layers
- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
- Implement forward and backward propagation
- Apply random initialization to your neural network
- Increase fluency in Deep Learning notations and Neural Network Representations
- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Compute the cross entropy loss
